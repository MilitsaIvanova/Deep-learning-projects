# Welcome to my Deep Learning Projects Repository!

This repository is a collection of various deep learning projects I have worked on, showcasing my journey and progress in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Projects Included

- **Project 1: Sentiment Analysis using NLP techniques and BERT**
  - **Objective**: Analyze sentiment in text data using a state-of-the-art NLP model.
  - **Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification/data.
  - **Methods**: Utilized BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment classification.
  - **Results**: Summary of sentiment analysis performance and insights gained.

- **Project 2: Content-based Recommendation Engine using NLP**
  - **Objective**: Develop a recommendation engine based on the content of items.
  - **Dataset**: Dataset provided by a large company in retail. The dataset is confidential and cannot be disclosed.
  - **Methods**: Implemented NLP techniques to analyze and recommend items based on textual content.
  - **Results**: Created a test method to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the recommendation system.
    
- **Project 3: Depression in Retirement: Unraveling the Silent Epidemic through SHARE Data Analysis****
  - **Objective**: Examine the prevalence, determinants, and underlying factors of depression among retired individuals in Europe.
  - **Dataset**: Data from the SHARE survey.
  - **Methods**: Build a Neural Network model which can predict whether an individual is depressed or not.
  - **Results**: Test Accuracy: 0.9521, Test F1: 0.9147, Test Recall: 0.8980.
